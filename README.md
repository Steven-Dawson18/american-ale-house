### Aim <a name="aim"></a>
The American Ale House is an ecommerce website allowing users to purchase American brewed beers developed for my Project 5 as part of the Code Institute - Diploma in Software Development (Full stack) Diploma.

### Description
The American Ale House websiteprovides the user the ability to purchase American brewed beers in the UK. Firstly upon landing on the site you are greeted with an elegant image which clearly protrays the purpose of the site. As a non logged in user you can browse all the products and add the ones you want into your bag ready for checkout. You can checkout by entering all your details and entering a valid credit card. Once your order is complete you will see a confirmation page and a confirmation email will be sent to your email. As a logged in user you will be able to checkout faster as your default address will be in your profile. You will also be able to view your order history and leave reviews on products that you have purchased. The logged in user will also be able to add products to their favourites for a quicker purchase next time. If you sign up to the site you will recieve a Coupon code which you will be able to redeem at checkout for a discount on your shop.

### **User registration not required**

I felt it was important the user was given the option to purchase from the site without having to register for an account. Some sites annoy me when I have to make an account to make a purchase.

If the user doesn't have an account, they are still able to make a purchase, add a delivery address and have a confirmation email sent to them when it has completed. 


## Database Design <a name="database"></a>
[Database Schema](/readme_images/database-design.png)

#### **User Account**

This app enables authenticated users to save their information so that when they are logged in the order form is pre-filled, creating an improved user experience. The `UserProfile` model has a one-to-one field that is linked to the Django AllAuth user account, upon logging in the model method `create_or_update_user_profile` creates the profile if it isn't already present in the model.

The second model in this app is `UserWishlist`, this model has two foreign keys, one relating to the `UserProfile` and the other is `Product`. This model stores the products that the user wants to be saved to their wishlist. This information is then displayed in the wishlist view.

#### **Products App**

This app controls the products that are displayed and the reviews and ratings for those products. I have created three models to store the necessary data: `Category`, `Products` & `ReviewRating`.

`Category` stores the various category types of the Ales on sale, this allows the user to filter the products by the category if they are looking for something specific.

`Products` enables individual products to be added to the database in order for them to be purchased via the online shop. Only admin users are able to access this functionality and it can be done from the front end using the `add_product` view. This model has one FK which relates to the second model in this app, the category.

`reviewRating` enables individuals to leave a review of a product so that new users can read these on the product detals page which will help them to decide to purchase or not. This model has one FK which relates to the products model in this app.

#### **Favourites**

The Favourites app is used by a logged in user to store their favourite products which will make finding them easirer the next time they visit the store. There is one model, `Favourites`.

`Favourites` contains a Fk to the product and a one to many field to the user. Once a logged in user adds a product to their favourite it will be stored on that page for them for quick reference when the come back to the store, making purchasing that bit easier and faster.

#### **Checkout**

The checkout app is used for the user to make purchases. This app contains three models, `Order`, `OrderItem` & `Coupon`. 

`OrderItem` contains all of the information regarding the products that have been purchased as part of a specific order. It has a foreign key to `Product` & `Order`, it also contains the quantity purchased of that product and then the item total. This information is used to calculate the total cost for the order. For the product FK I chose to use `on_delete=models.CASCADE`, using the 'original basket' field the admin can still see what the original purchase was.

`Order` contains all of the relevant address information for billing/shipping, a foreign key to the `UserProfile`, a foreign key to the `Coupon`, email & phone number. It also contains information regarding the payment itself, the stripe PID, original bag. Each order has an order number which is automatically generated when a new order is added to the database using `UUID`.

`update_total` calculates the overall total depending on the order items linked to the order, ensuring the value is always correct.

`Coupon` contains a coupon code and a discount value. It is a Fk of the `Order` model and if a code is added on the checkout summary page that exists in the database then the discount will be added.

## Scope <a name="scope"></a>

 * A simple, straightforward, intuitive UX experience;
 * An explicit content; 
 * An easy navigation for the user through all the features;

## Business Model

+ A traditional B2C (Business to Customer) application has been chosen, with a straightforward and user-friendly responsive interface.

+ This online store offers American Ale products to the final customer.

## Marketing <a name="marketing"></a>

+ This site has a Facebook Business Page with a link on the page footer. It can be viewed here:
[American Ale House Facebook Page](https://www.facebook.com/AmericanAleHouseUK/)
[American Ale House Facebook Page Images](/readme_images/facebook-img-1.png)
[American Ale House Facebook Page Images](/readme_images/facebook-img-2.png)

+ Users can subscribe to our newsletter to receive all offers in their email box. Subscription links are available on the footer on all pages. 

+ Upon registering, the user is redirected to a new page confirming their subscription. The site owner can now see the new subscriber on their audience dashboard, and new campaigns will be sent to them too.

+ Once a user has signed up they will receive a discount code to apply at checkout.

+ I have searched similar websites and google gor good key words to apply to the site for SEO purposes:

- Beer
- Ale
- Larger
- Draught
- American Ale

- THE BEST AMERICAN ALES DELIVERED DIRECT TO YOUR DOOR

- I have used the meta description and keywords to improve the SEO

Heroku needs to know which technologies are being used and any requirements, so I created files to let it know. Before creating the Heroku app, create these files using the following steps in GitPod: 
* In the GitPod terminal, type ```pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt``` to create your requirements file.
* Create your Procfile and insert the following code: ```web: gunicorn american_ale_house.wsgi``` and make sure there is no additional blank line after it. 
* Push these files to your repository.

### Creating Heroku App
* Log into Heroku
* Select 'Create New App' from your dashboard
* Choose an app name (if there has been an app made with that name, you will be informed and will need to choose an alternative)
* Select the appropriate region based on your location
* Click 'Create App'

### Connecting to GitHub
* From the dashboard, click the 'Deploy' tab towards the top of the screen
* From here, locate 'Deployment Method' and choose 'GitHub'
* From the search bar newly appeared, locate your repository by name
* When you have located the correct repository, click 'Connect'
* DO NOT CLICK 'ENABLE AUTOMATIC DEPLOYMENT': This can cause unexpected errors before configuration. We'll come back to this.

### Environment Variables
* Click the 'Settings' tab towards the top of the page
* Locate the 'Config Vars' and click 'Reveal Config Vars'
* Enter all variables needed:
SECRET_KEY - `<Random key generated online or manually>`
DATABASE_URL - `<Postgres generated>`
USE_AWS: `True`
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: `<your AWS access key id, generated in the AWS console after user creation>`
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: `<your secret AWS access key, generated in the AWS console after user creation>`
STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY: `<your Stripe public key from the Stripe dashboard>`
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY: `<your Stripe secret key from the Stripe dashboard>`
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_KEY: `<your Stripe webhook key.>`
EMAIL_ADDRESS - `<Site's email address>` 
EMAIL_PASSWORD - `<Password from email client>`

### Heroku Postgres Database
* AWS S3 Buckets
* Paste variable in to Heroku config vars.

### Heroku Postgres Database
* Go to the resources tab in Heroku.
* In the Add-ons search bar look for Heroku Postgres & select it.
* Choose the Hobby Dev-Free option in plans.
* Click submit order form.
* Go back to the build environment and install 2 more requirements:
  * ```pip3 install dj_databse_url```
  * ```pip3 install psycopg2-binary```
  make sure to add these to the requirements file using ```pip3 freeze > requirements.txt``` 

## Set up Emails

## I used Gmail for the email on the contact page. Others can be used but will need a few changes**

* Go to settings.py and change the EMAIL_HOST_USER to your chosen email address.
* If you want to set up a new Gmail account for the site, this is the time to do so.
* Go to the Gmail account and open the 'Settings' tab.
* Go to 'Accounts and Imports' > 'Other Google Account Settings'.
* Go to the 'Security' tab and open 'Signing in to Google'.
* Click on '2-step Verification', click 'Get Started' and turn on 2-step verification following their instructions.
* Go to 'Security' > 'Signing in to Google' > 'App Passwords'.
* (You may have to input your account password again) Set 'App' to 'Mail', 'Device' to Other, and name it Django.
* The passcode that appears will be used in your Heroku variables.

## Deploy
* In Heroku, once all the variables are in place, locate 'Manual Deploy' > choose the master branch and click 'Deploy Branch'.
* Once the app is built (it may take a few minutes), click 'Open App' from the top of the page.
* Go back to the 'Deploy' tab and you can now click 'Enable Automatic Deployment'. Changes automatically deploy when you make a git push.

## Forking the Repository
* Log in to GitHub and locate the GitHub Repository.
* At the top of the Repository above the "Settings" Button on the menu, locate the "Fork" Button.
* You will have a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account.
* You will now be able to make changes to the new version and keep the original safe. 

## Making a Local Clone
* Log into GitHub.
* Locate the repository.
* Click the 'Code' dropdown above the file list.
* Copy the URL for the repository.
* Open Git Bash on your device.
* Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory.
* Type ```git clone``` in the CLI and then paste the URL you copied earlier. This is what it should look like:
  * ```$ git clone https://github.com/Steven-Dawson18/american-ale-house```
* Press Enter to create your local clone.

You will need to install all of the packages listed in the requirements file you can use the following command in the terminal ```pip install -r requirements.txt``` which will do it for you.
